Titanic Dataset - Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)

Overview
This project is focused on performing an Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) on the Titanic dataset. The goal is to understand the dataset using statistical summaries and visualizations. EDA helps identify patterns, trends, outliers, and potential relationships between different features of the dataset.

Project Objectives
Generate Summary Statistics: Display basic statistical details like mean, median, and standard deviation for numeric columns in the dataset.

Visualizations:

Histograms: Create histograms to explore the distribution of numeric features like Age.

Boxplots: Visualize the spread and detect outliers in numerical features.

Pairplots: Display relationships between pairs of numeric features.

Correlation Matrix: Generate a heatmap to analyze correlations between numerical features.

Skewness Detection: Evaluate the skewness of numerical features to check for the asymmetry in their distributions.

Identify Patterns, Trends, and Anomalies: Use visualizations and statistical measures to identify any patterns or trends in the dataset and detect anomalies (like outliers or skewed distributions).

Tools and Libraries Used
Pandas: For data manipulation and analysis.

NumPy: For numerical operations.

Matplotlib: For data visualization.

Seaborn: For creating enhanced data visualizations.

Dataset
This project uses the Titanic dataset, which includes information about passengers such as their age, fare, survival status, and more. The dataset is available publicly and can be used for data analysis and machine learning tasks.

Steps Followed in the Project
Loading the Data: The Titanic dataset is loaded into a pandas DataFrame.

Summary Statistics: Basic statistical metrics are calculated for numeric columns.

Visualizations: Histograms, boxplots, pairplots, and correlation matrices are generated to explore the data visually.

Skewness: Skewness of numerical features is calculated to assess the symmetry of the data.

Patterns and Anomalies: Through visualizations and statistical analysis, patterns, trends, and anomalies are identified.

Key Observations
Distribution of Age: The histogram and boxplot for the 'Age' feature help in understanding its distribution and detecting any skewness or outliers.

Correlations: The correlation matrix reveals relationships between different numerical features, which can help in understanding how different variables relate to each other.

Skewness: Skewness in the 'Age' or other numerical features can be checked to determine if any transformations (like log transformations) might be necessary before modeling.

Outliers: Boxplots help in visualizing potential outliers that may need to be handled before further analysis.

Conclusion
The EDA process provides valuable insights into the dataset, helping to identify key features, detect anomalies, and understand relationships between variables. These insights form the foundation for building more advanced models or for performing further analysis.
